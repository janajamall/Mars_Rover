# Mars Rover Prototype - Embedded Systems Project

This project is a prototype of a Mars Rover implemented using the **PIC16F877A** microcontroller. It simulates essential functionalities of an autonomous exploration rover, including obstacle detection, motor control, servo-based scanning, and optional remote control.

The system demonstrates real-time embedded programming, integration of sensors and actuators, and effective use of the PIC16F877A's features such as ADC, PWM, interrupts, and timers.
